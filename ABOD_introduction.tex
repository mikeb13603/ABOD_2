Point of this paper: comprehensive review of the trends in inequality, and in the level and composition of poverty that one gets with different measures of household resources. 

Measurements of inequality or poverty require us to measure the living standards achieved by, or the resources available to, households. There is a long debate over whether this is best done with income or consumption. Despite theoretical reasons to prefer the use of consumption as a general measure of a household's living standards (\cite{Poterba1989}, Cutler and Katz (1992), Slesnick (1993)), and practical reasons to prefer the use of consumption to identify the poorest (Meyer and Sullivan 2003, 2004, 2008, 2011; Meyer, Kok (or Bee?and Sullivan); Brewer, Etheridge and O'Dea, forthcoming. [Mike NEEDs to CHECK TO FIND OUT WHICH ARE ABOUT MEASUREMENT ISSUES]), it is common in developed countries to assess inequality with respect to the distribution of household income, and to use poverty lines defined with respect to household income. 

However, these arguments for or against the use of consumption rather than income are of little practical importance if trends in living standards, inequality or poverty were similar for the two measures, and if the set of households with a low consumption were the broadly similar to those with a low income. Using a long span of consistent survey-based micro-data on income and consumption for the same households, this paper therefore assesses what impact the way we measure household resources has on our impression of trends in the level and distribution of living standards, and the composition of those in poverty in the UK. 

In doing this, we develop the findings of Brewer, Etheridge and O'Dea (forthcoming), which documents thoroughly the mis-match between reported income and reported spending for households with low resources in the UK and presents evidence that this is much more likely to be due to under-reporting of income than either over-reporting of spending or consumption-smoothing. We stress, though, that even if one takes a different view on the underlying causes, the significant mismatch between measures of income and consumption for households with low resources remains, and it is important to know to what extent income and consumption give different impressions of trends in, and the composition of, households with low resources. 

Our broad approach is to analyse (and then compare) the trends in the level and distribution of households' resources, and the risk factors of having low resources, using both income and consumption as our measure of household resources. In doing so, we pay particular attention to the role of the implicit rental income derived from, or the implicit consumption flow from, owner-occupied housing.

We go beyond the literature in three main ways - first long time span

explicit consideration of the role of implicit rental income/consumption of housing 

This is important for two reasons. First, some work which has compared the use of income and consumption to measure well-being has, in effect, compared a measure of disposable, cash, incomes with a measure of full consumption, including the consumption flows from durables, such as housing ([justify this!]). This is an unfair comparison; it is just as sensible to think that consumer durables provide their owners with an implicit stream of rental income as it is to think that they provide an implicit stream of consumption (and we must think in this way if we work with the Haig-Simons concept that income less consumption equals change in net worth). Instead, we proceed by first comparing the usual measure of disposable cash income with an equivalent measure of consumption, and then assessing what changes when we add to these the implicit rent or consumption flow from housing.  Second, despite the recommendations of the Canberra Group on measuring income ([reference]), all official and most academic analysis of household incomes in the UK uses an income concept that does not include implicit rental income (and the partial availability of data on implicit rental income means that most international comparisons do likewise; see, e.g., Morelli et al (2015) [handbook chapter]), and our analysis therefore presents the most comprehensive assessment of what impact including the implicit rent from home ownership [Mike says: we must agree and then standardise how I refer to this; I used a different phrase in chapters 4-6] would have on an analysis of the income distribution in the UK.    

Our results can be grouped into four areas. 

First, we find that the distribution of income and consumption are quite different, in every year of our data. There was little difference between summary measures of inequality in income and consumption in the first half of the 1980s, but income inequality then grew considerably faster, where it remains less equally distributed than consumption. [Or: ``Inequality and relative poverty grew less rapidly when measured with consumption, partly because consumption at the bottom grew more strongly than income in the 1980s, and because consumption at the top grew less strongly than income in the 1990 and 2000s [Mike notes: text following "`partly"' not all shown in this paper.]'']. A similar story is true for measures of relative poverty (having a household income, or consumption, below 60\% of the national median). [Resources have grown by more when assessed using income than consumption (particularly in the late 1980s and late 2000s).]  

Second, we present empirical evidence that the set of households with a low consumption are more likely to reflect households who have low permanent resources, as standard economic theory would suggest, than the set of households with a low income. Although this does not necessarily mean that policy-makers should target anti-poverty programmes on those with a low consumption, it does mean that one should look at consumption as well as/instead of income when assessing trends in poverty, and particularly when assessing which groups in society are at risk of poverty. [Mike asks Abi and Cormac: having written this, I feel like resurrecting the DiD analysis that Cormac did, directly assessing how well consumption and income are at identifying the deprived!]. 

Third, at an aggregate level, we show that adding the implicit income or consumption from housing to measures of household resources makes a substantial difference to average annual growth rates in household living standards over the past 30 years, even after an appropriate correction to the price deflator [, and particular so for elderly households] [Mike notes: last bit was in Brewer and O'Dea but is not currently shown in this paper], and also reduces the apparent growth in inequality in household resources. 

Fourth, at a micro-level, moving to a measure of resources that includes 
the implicit income or consumption from housing alters the characteristics of those deemed to be poor by giving less weight [wrong phrase] to those more likely to be temporarily poor (the unemployed and those with high education);



The rest of the paper is arranged as follows.  Section \ref{sec:literature} provides a literature review. Section \ref{sec:measure} discusses how we construct measures of consumption and income from 30 years worth of household surveys.  Section \ref{sec:trends} compares how living standards in the UK have changed over the past 30 years when assessed with household income and household consumption, and examines trends in summary measures of inequality and poverty. Section \ref{sec:composition} examines how our impression of who is poor changes when we switch from using income to using consumption as the measure of resources. Section \ref{sec:housing} assesses how important is the treatment of implicit income from housing when constructing measures of household living standards. Section \ref{sec:conclusion} concludes. Appendices provide more detail on the underlying data sources, and supplementary results.
