Analysis of trends in inequality or poverty, or of the composition of the poor, require an assessment of the living standards of households. Despite theoretical reasons to prefer the use of consumption over income as a general measure of a household's living standards, and practical reasons to prefer the use of consumption to identify the poorest, in developed countries it is common to assess inequality with respect to the distribution of household income, and to use poverty lines defined with respect to household income. With a long span of survey-based micro-data on income and consumption for the same households, we contrast the different impressions one gets when using household income or household consumption to assess the trends in low living standards, and the composition of those in poverty. We find that moving from low income to low consumption as a measure of poverty identifies households that are more likely have low permanent resources, as does adding the implicit income or consumption from housing, as standard economic theory would suggest. We also show that adding the implicit income or consumption from housing to a measure of household resources has dramatic impacts on the age- and cohort-profile of poverty in the UK.
